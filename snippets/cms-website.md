# Website plan

## Markdown v/s Wordpress CMS
* Cannot use custom components/HTML. See following examples -
  * [shasum](https://quarkjs.io/download/)
  * [download page](https://quarkjs.io/download/)
  * [custom signature](https://quarkjs.io/FAQ/about.html)

## What can we do about it?
* You use wordpress (scalability issues, maintenance e.t.c)
* You learn to write markdown
* OR
  * Use wordpress as CMS
  * Convert wordpress website to markdown

## Type of content
* Exactly as same as [fireship.io](https://fireship.io)
  1. Courses - paid as well as free
  2. one-to-one video mapping
  3. quick snippets
  4. tags
  5. NOT categories (see below)

## Discuss data structure
* Get categories list (Do we even need category?)
* Get tags list

## Meta material
* Comments section (slack v/s disqus)
* Analytics stuff
* Image compression (because terrible football analyses was very heavy)

## Money things
* Adobe premium pro (aayu would see plans /feasibility e.t.c)
* Elastic search/Algolia
