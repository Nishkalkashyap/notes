# Email response

###### Hey MannU, thanks for taking time to review the Quark software. _**It really means a lot**_ ðŸ˜­
I've asked many people before for a review, and this is the first time I'm getting any response, let alone such an in-depth response. So thank you for that. ðŸ˜„

##### Let me answer all your Queries one by one:

###### 1. _`I like your project idea. (Correct me if I am wrong in my understanding) Quark aims to develop prototypes easily`_
* Yes, that is exactly the point. It is a developer tool, that helps you rapidly create prototypes and functional softwares that can make your life as a developer a little easy. 
* It abstracts away the complexity of setting up a project environment every time you start a new project. 
* Imaging configuring python environment on your PC every time you start a python project. Doesn't makes sense right?

::: not
Currently there are very less `graphical user interface` runtime environments. Exceptions being things like MATLAB, and jupyter notebook. Which have there pros and cons. Quark aims to fill that void by providing `HTML, CSS and Javascript` powered GUI's, since this stack is the undisputed king for frontend development.

Also, Quark is fully extensible (unlike MATLAB). You can install (almost) any of the 900,000 packages on the [npm repository](https://npmjs.com) and use the packages you're already fimiliar with. You don't need to lean anything new if you're already fimiliar with the stack.

###### 2. _`Since Quark aims to be an IDE, it would make complete sense to integrate a debugger to debug large codebases `_
* Yes, it makes sense for _large codebases_. But admittedly Quark does not intends to cater for _large codebase_ projects. 
* Again, it is intended only for functional projects. Just like you saw on [showcase page](https://quarkjs.io/guide/showcase.html). 
* Every project on that page was made from 80 to 300 lines of code. And thats all.
* Also, if you build project with typescript _(reccomended)_ instead of javascript. You can catch all the errors at compile time, instead of runtime. So that can somewhat accommodate for the lack of debugger.

####### Infact you can catch errors while typing. The inbuilt language support constantly checks for errors in a seperate process. So ypu're aware of errors in your code even before compiling your code.

###### 3. _`I wish to provide you with software advice. "It is not about making, it's about maintaining".`_
* **Agreed!** That is why after developing the initial build of Quark. I took another month or so to refactoring the code. It was a pain in the _ass_ but was worth it. 
* As far as the maintainence goes, Quark uses a Continuous delivery pipeline, that builds the code, tests it and if required then deploys a new release. The entire process is automated in a single commad. `git commit -m 'new-release'`. Thats all.
* It is virtually **not possible** for me to push a bad release because the code is end-to-end tested on every commit. And I push at least 10's of commits every day.  

!!! abstract Sidenote: You can find the CI/CD tests here:

###### 4. _`Help me get started on the System Resource monitor project`_
* Sure, in fact i'll send you a repo link (probably by my evening) with the project. I'll add a `readme.md` file to get you started.

###### 5. _`Keep me posted about new developments.`_
* Sure.

#### A few of my own Questions:

###### 1. _`Did you find documentation somewhat readable? If so, I was planning to make the project public this week. It'll be good to have a feedback on that. (Ofcourse I'll add a good landing page before that.) `_

###### 2. _`Did you get a chance to download and just open the software? If so, please let me know how does the UI feels and looks.`_

###### 3. _`Would you prefer javascript or typescript for for the "system resource monitor project" ?`_
