# Documentation
<!-- [Reference](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-to-get-started-on-your-companys-internal-documentation/) -->

[[toc]]

Hello,

I would like to make a recommendation to build the internal documentation of the company, documenting our - processes, routines, code repositories, infrastructure and networks at the very least.

## Why do we need a documentation?

### 1. Knowledge transfer
Perhaps this would be one of the main reasons of making the documentation. What if even a few of our key people decide to leave? How much of the know-how essential to our companyâ€™s success exists only in the heads of a small number of people?

The documentation would help smoothen the transition when people leave and help preserve the know-how of the company.

### 2. Help integrate new employees
Another important function that this documentation can serve, is to create introductory material that not only keeps new hires occupied but also tells them more about how the company works.

Such information can cover both their team and other groups, giving them a head start on their new responsibilities.

### 4. Reference for current employees
This documentation can also act as a reference document for current employees to look for best practices and reinforce standardization in their respective departments. Such documentation could help prevent people from having to reinvent the wheel.

_____________________________________________________________

### The Implementation
Such documentation can exist as a website, only accessible through the company's private network.

I've created a basic implementation for such a website, temporarily accessible on edfora.nishkal.in . Use this temporary URL, to access the website and make recommendations/ comment on the feasibility of such a project.
